# j1-league-web-scraper

This project aims to scrape data for players belonging to the Japanese J1 League. This is in response to a request from a football club in Japan that is interested in analysing detailed player information.

The project will produce two Excel files containing the following data:

1. **`Player Information`**: An Excel file including each player's name, team, birthplace, nationality, height, weight, and previous clubs.
2. **`Playing Time Statistics`**: An Excel file containing time spent by each player in the following categories:
   * Time in Last Appearance
   * Time Played in Full Match
   * Time Spent as Reserve
   * Time since Subbed On
   * Time until Subbed Off
   * Time as Non-squad Member
